5/10/24 notes - was looking at different merging options also

was working on getting us missing latitude and longitude coordinates until i had actual work to do at work last night and then ran out of time at work. im planning on revisiting getting our missing latitude and longitude coordinates for the SHD.csv 

when I wake up later I'm gonna work on that.
