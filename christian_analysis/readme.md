README: School Shooting Data Analysis Project
In this project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of school shooting incidents, using datasets that include detailed records from 1999 to 2023. We focused on understanding the distribution of these tragic events over time and across different locations in the United States. By examining annual and monthly trends, we identified fluctuations and possible seasonal patterns that might suggest when school shootings are more likely to occur. We utilized Python and libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib to manipulate the data and create visualizations that clearly depict these trends.

Our analysis also extended to different characteristics of the incidents, specifically looking at factors such as whether the incidents were preplanned, involved bullying, or were related to gang activities. Although we were limited by the absence of detailed perpetrator demographics and mental health data, we successfully analyzed available information to draw meaningful insights. This included examining the time of day most incidents occur and identifying which types of schools—elementary, high schools, or private institutions—face higher risks of such events. These insights help in understanding the contexts in which school shootings tend to happen and can aid in developing targeted preventative measures.

Finally, the project also addressed the geographical spread of incidents, providing a state-level view of where school shootings are more prevalent. Despite challenges like missing data on specific risk factors or warning signs, the project synthesized available information to highlight critical patterns and trends. This project serves as an educational tool that not only enhances understanding of a grave issue but also promotes data literacy by demonstrating how data analysis can be applied to real-world problems. The methodologies and findings are documented in a way that high school students, especially those in their junior year, can understand, making it accessible and educational for a broad audience.
